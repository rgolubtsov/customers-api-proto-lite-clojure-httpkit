# Customers API Lite microservice prototype :small_orange_diamond: <img src="https://clojure.org/images/clojure-logo-icon-256.png" style="border:0;width:32px" alt="Clojure" />

**A daemon written in Clojure, designed and intended to be run as a microservice,
<br />implementing a special Customers API prototype with a smart yet simplified data scheme**

**Rationale:** This project is a *direct* **[Clojure](https://clojure.org "The Clojure Programming Language")** port of the earlier developed **Customers API Lite microservice prototype**, written in Crystal using **[Kemal](https://kemalcr.com "Lightning Fast, Super Simple Web Framework for Crystal")** web framework, and tailored to be run as a microservice in a Docker container. The following description of the underlying architecture and logics has been taken **[from here](https://github.com/rgolubtsov/customers-api-proto-lite-crystal-kemal/blob/main/README.md)** almost as is, without any principal modifications or adjustment.
